## kmeans()

Demo of using kmeans() function in base R. First make up some data with a known structure. 

```{r}
tmp <- c(rnorm(30, -3), rnorm(30, 3))
x <- cbind(x=tmp, y=rev(tmp))
x
```

```{r}
plot(x)
```

Now we have some made up data in 'x' let's see hpw kmeans works with this data.

```{r}
k <- kmeans(x, centers=2, nstart =20)
k
```
> Q. How many points are in each cluster?

```{r}
k$size
```

> Q. How do we get to the cluster membership/assignment?

```{r}
k$cluster
```

> Q. What about cluster centers?

```{r}
k$centers
```

Now we got to the main results. Let's use them to plot out data with the kmeans result.

```{r}
plot(x, col=k$cluster)
points(k$centers, col="blue", pch=15)
```
